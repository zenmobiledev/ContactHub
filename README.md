# Installation
You can either **download the APK release** or **build the project locally**.

## Option 1: Download & Install APK
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/zenmobiledev/ContactHub/releases) page.  
2. Download the latest release asset: ```contact-hub.zip```.
3. Extract the ```.zip``` file â€” inside you will find the ```.apk```.
4. Transfer the APK to your Android device (if downloaded on PC).  
5. Install the APK on your device.  
   - You might need to allow installation from unknown sources.  
6. Launch the app and enjoy.

## Option 2: Build from Source (How to run the project)

### 1. Clone the repository

>- ```https://github.com/zenmobiledev/ContactHub.git```
>- ```cd ContactHub```

### 2. Open the project

>- Open the project in your preferred IDE (Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA).

### 3. Build the project

Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed. In Android Studio or intelliJ IDEA, you can
typically do this by:

>- **Syncing the Project**: The IDE should automatically prompt you to sync the project with the
   Gradle files. If not, you can manually sync by clicking on the "Sync Project with Gradle Files"
   button.
>- **Building the Project:** Navigate to the ```Build``` menu and select ```Compile All Sources``` (On newer Android Studio versions) or ```Make Project``` (On older Android Studio versions). This
   process will compile the code and prepare the application for running.

### 4. Run the application

After the build process completes successfully:

>- **Select a Device**: Choose an emulator or a physical device connected to your computer where
   you want to run the application.

>- **Launch the App**: Click on the green 'Run' button (usually depicted as a play icon) in the IDE
   toolbar, or navigate to ```Run``` > ```Run 'app'```. This action will install and start the
   application on the selected device.
